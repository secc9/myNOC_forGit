    <h1>My exploration through the Armin Hofmann Graphic Design Manual</h1>
    <p>In this project I will be making my way through the Armin Hofmann Graphic Design Manual in
      an attempt to ground myself in the fundamentals of design theory. <br>
      It is my hope that working through this book I will begin to internalise the swiss style of design. <br>
      Throughout this project I will be limiting myself to using only the Processing software. Teaching myself to create graphics whilst at the same time as expanding on my coding knowledge.<br>

      By the end of this project I hope to have an interesting body of work for display.
